# #FRONTEND CHALLENGE
## Frontend Mentor - QR code component
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

The challenge was to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
I used HTML5 and CSS to build out the QR code component and deployed the project on Github pages (https://mishywayu.github.io/QRcodecomponent.github.io/)
